Section 04: Summary of Local and Global Variables
-----------------------------------------------------------

Summary of Global Variables

	Scope - Global variables are visible to all the
	functions of a program. They are everywhere. Even
	you can access global variables from another file
	of the project.

	Default value - All uninitialized global variables
	will have 0 as default value.

	Lifetime - Until the end of the execution of the
	program.


Summary of Local Variables

	Scope - Within the body of the function. Local
	variables lose existence once the execution
	control comes out of the function body.

	Default value - unpredictable (garbage value).

	Lifetime - Until the end of the execution of a
	function in which a variable is defined.
