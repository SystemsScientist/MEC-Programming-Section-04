Section 04: Char Data Type and Variable Definition
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Integer Data Type: char

	- This is an integer data type to store a single 
	  character (ASCII code) value or 1 byte of
	  signed integer value (+ve or -ve value)
	
	- A char data type variable consumes 1 byte of
	  memory
	
	- char happens to be the smallest integer data
	  type of 1 byte
	
	- There is no other special meaning for the char
	  data type, and it is just another integer data
	  type


Range of char Data Type

	- char range: -128 to 127

		+ A char data type will be used to store
		  1 byte of signed data
	
	- Unsigned char range: 0 to 255

		+ An unsigned char data type will be 
		  used to store 1 byte of unsigned data


Setup

	I want to store the current temperature data of
	city 'X' in my program

	City X's today's temperature is 25 degrees Celsius

	I am sure that X's temperature never goes below 0
	degrees and never goes above 40 degrees Celsius

	That means City X's temperature will always be a
	positive value, and the max value is less than 25

	So, here we can use unsigned char data type to
	represent temperature value


Example 1

	unsigned char cityXTemperature;
	cityXTemperature = 25;

	Here, cityXTemperature is a variable of type
	unsigned char to hold the integer value 25


Variable Definition I

	unsigned char cityXTemperature; 
	cityXTemperature = 25;

	Where unsigned char cityXTemperature is the
	variable definition and cityXTemperature = 25
	is the variable initialization


Variable Definition II

	- Variable definition always includes "data
	  type" followed by a "variable name"

	- Before using a variable, you should always
	  define it using appropriate data type
	
	- You can select the data type according to
	  your program logic and need


Example 2

	- Store the sun's temperature value in a 
	  program
	
	- Sun's surface temperature is 5,5505 degrees
	  Celsius

	- Moreover, we know that it will never be -ve
	  value for another few billion years
	
	- So we can consider it as unsigned data
	  (+ve data)
	
	- 5505 > 255, so we cannot use unsigned char

	- So, in this case, we can safely use the 
	  unsigned short int data type like below

	  unsigned short sunTemperature = 5005;
