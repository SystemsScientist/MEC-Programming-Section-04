Section 04: Data Types in 'C'
----------------------------------------------------------

Data Types

	- Data type is used for declaring the type
	  of a variable
	
	- In C programming, data types determine the
	  type and size of data associated with 
	  variables
	
	- Before storing any value in a variable, 
	  programmer should decide its type


Representing Real World Data

	- Data as numbers (integer or real numbers)

	- Data as characters

	- Data as strings (collection of characters)


Examples

	- Roy's age is '44' years, '6' months and 
	  '200' days
	
	- The temperature of the city is '+27.2'
	  degress Celsius
	
	- Today's date is '21st' of June

	- I got an 'A' grade in my school assignment


Data types

	Based on the real-world data we have two 
	significant data types in C


'C' Data Types

	Integer data types

		Used to represent whole numbers
		(integers)

			Example: 10, 20, 30, etc.
	
	Float data types

		Used to represent real numbers

			Example: 10, 24.5, 3.14,
			6.28, 60.000001, etc.


Integer Data Types (for signed data)

	- char

	- short int

		+ also referred by just "short"

		+ "int" is assumed

		+ "short int" is synonymous with
		  "short

	- int

	- long int

		+ also referred to as "long"

		+ "int" is assumed

	- long long int

		+ also referred to as "long long"

		+ "int" is assumed
	
	- Note: signed data can be positive or 
	  negative


Integer Data Types (for unsigned data)

	- unsigned char

	- unsigned short int

	- unsigned int

	- unsigned long int

	- unsigned long long int

	- Note: unsigned data can only hold a
	  positive sign
