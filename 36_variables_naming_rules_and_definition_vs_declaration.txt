Section 04: Variables Naming Rules and Definition vs Declaration
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

What are variables?

	- Variables are identifiers for your data

	- Data are usually stored in computer memory

	- So, a variable acts as a label to a memory
	  location where the data is stored

	- Variable names are not stored inside the
	  computer memory, and the compiler replaces
	  them with memory location addresses during 
	  data manipulation


Example 1

	#include <stdio.h>

	int main(void) {

		// valueA and valueB are variables of type char
		char valueA = 20; // 20 is data stored in valueA
		char valueB = 30; // 30 is data stored in valueB

		printf("Size of valueA = %d\n", sizeof(valueA));
		printf("Size of valueB = %d\n", sizeof(valueB));

		return 0;
	}


Note 1

	- Memory location addresses are pointers
	
	- valueA is a name assigned to the memory location address
	  to retrieve the data stored

	- Variable name exists for programming convenience and
	  doesn't exist post-compilation, only its associated
	  memory location address does


Defining Variables I

	- Before you use a variable, you have to define it

	- Variable definition (sometimes also called a variable
	  declaration) is nothing more than letting the compiler
	  know you will need some memory space for your program
	  data so it can reserve some


Defining Variables II

	- To define a variable, you only need to state its type,
	  followed by a variable name
	
	- If the data type of the variable is char, then the
	  compiler reserves 1 byte
	
	- If the data type is int then the compiler reserves 4
	  bytes


Syntax: Defining Varaibles

	'C' Syntax of variable definition

	<data_type> <variable_name>


Example 

	char myExamScore; // This is called a variable definition


Variable Initialization

	char myExamScore; // variable definition

	myExamScore = 25; // variable initialization

	Observe that variable initialization is followed by first
	defining the variable

	***Please Note:

	The above notes regarding variable initialization are
	incorrect. myExamScore =25 is a variable assignment.
	According to C Primer Plus, Fifth Edition, by Stephen
	Prata, a variable declaration is a data type followed
	by a variable name; a variable assignment is a value
	assigned (=) to a variable; and an initialization is
	a data type followed by a variable name, which is then
	assigned a value (Page 56). See below:

	char myExamScore;      // declaration
	myExamScore = 25;      // assignment
	char myExamScore = 25; // initialization


Rules for Naming a Variable

	- Make sure that the variable name is not more than
	  30 characters - some compilers may issue errors
	
	- A variable name can only contain alphabets (both
	  upper and lowercase), digits, and underscore
	
	- The first letter of the variable cannot be a digit
	  - it should be either an alphabet or underscore
	
	- You cannon use 'C' standard reserved keywords as
	  variable names


Variable Definition vs Declaration

	- A variable is defined when the compiler generates
	  instructions to allocate the storage for the 
	  variable
	
	- A variable is declared when the compiler is informed
	  that a variable exists along with its data type - the
	  compiler does not generate instructions to allocate
	  the storage for the variable at that point
	
	- A variable definition is also a declaration, but 
	  not all variable declarations are definitions
