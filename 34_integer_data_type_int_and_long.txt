Section 04: Integer Data Type 'int' and 'long'
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Integer Data Type: int and unsigned int

	- int is an integer data type to store signed
	  integer data
	
	- An int type variable consumes 2 bytes of memory
	  or 4 bytes of memory
	
	- Size of an int is decided by the compiler being
	  used to generate code for your target hardware,
	  i.e., you need to consult the compiler user 
	  manual to understand the size of an int - it is
	  typically 2 or 4 bytes
	
	- unsigned int is an integer data type to store
	  unsigned integer data


Integer Data Type: long and unsigned long

	- long is an integer data type to store signed
	  integer data
	
	- A long type variable consumes 4 bytes of 
	  memory or 8 bytes of memory
	
	- Size of long data type is decided by the compiler
	  being used to generate code for your target 
	  hardware, i.e., you need to consult the compiler
	  user manual to understand the size of long - it is
	  typically 4 or 8 bytes
	
	- unsigned long is an integer data type to store
	  unsigned integer data
