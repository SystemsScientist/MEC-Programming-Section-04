Section 04: Range Calculation for 'char' Data Type
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Range Calculation

	Let us calculate the range of char data type

		+ We know that variable of the char data
		  type consumes 1 byte of memory

		+ Also, the char data type will be used
		  to store 1 byte of signed data


Unsigned char Range

	- The unsigned char data type is used to store 1
	  byte of unsigned data
	
	- In unsigned data representation no particular
	  bit is dedicatedly used to encode the sign
