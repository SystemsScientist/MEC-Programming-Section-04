--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Integer Data type: short int and unsigned short int

	- Variable of type short int is used to store 2 bytes
	  of signed data
	
	- Variable of type unsigned short int is used to store
	  2 bytes of unsigned data
	
	- You can just mention short (for signed) or unsigned
	  short - "int" will be assumed

	- short type variable always consumes 2 bytes of memory
	  irrespective of compilers
